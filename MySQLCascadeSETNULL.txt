Step 1. Create the buildings table:

CREATE TABLE buildings (
    building_no INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    building_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
Step 2. Create the rooms table:

CREATE TABLE rooms (
    room_no INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    room_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    building_no INT NOT NULL,		|should not be not null
    FOREIGN KEY (building_no)
        REFERENCES buildings (building_no)
        ON DELETE CASCADE    | Set Null
);

Step 3. Insert rows into the buildings table:
INSERT INTO buildings(building_name,address)
VALUES('ACME Headquaters','3950 North 1st Street CA 95134'),
      ('ACME Sales','5000 North 1st Street CA 95134');

Step 4. Query data from the buildings table:

SELECT * FROM buildings;
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
MySQL ON DELETE CASCADE buildings table
We have two rows in the buildings table.

Step 5. Insert rows into the rooms table:

INSERT INTO rooms(room_name,building_no)
VALUES('Amazon',1),
      ('War Room',1),
      ('Office of CEO',1),
      ('Marketing',2),
      ('Showroom',2);

Step 6. Query data from the rooms table:

SELECT * FROM rooms;
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
MySQL ON DELETE CASCADE - rooms table

Step 7. Delete the building with building no. 2:

DELETE FROM buildings 
WHERE building_no = 2;

Step 8. Query data from rooms table:

SELECT * FROM rooms;
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
MySQL ON DELETE CASCADE - rooms table after delete
